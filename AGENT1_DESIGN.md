## 🔄 **Detailed Agent Flow**

### **Step-by-Step Process**

**Input Stage**
You start with a list of investors - either from your existing Airtable database, a CSV upload, or just names/firms you want to research. The agent takes this basic information (name, firm, maybe a LinkedIn URL) and begins the automated research process.

**Research & Profiling Stage**
The agent scrapes multiple sources to build comprehensive investor profiles. It hits LinkedIn to understand their background, recent posts, and portfolio companies. It pulls data from Crunchbase to see their investment history and preferences. It crawls their firm's website to extract their investment thesis and criteria. It also checks Twitter for recent activity and interests.

All this data gets compiled into a rich investor profile that includes their investment stage preferences, sector focus, typical check sizes, geographic preferences, portfolio companies, recent activity, and any warm connections you might have.

**Matching & Scoring Stage**
The agent then compares each investor profile against your company profile. It looks at whether your industry matches their sector focus, if your funding stage aligns with their preferences, whether your geographic location fits their criteria, and if there are synergies with their existing portfolio companies. 

Each investor gets a match score and the system prioritizes them by likelihood of interest. High-scoring investors get marked as priority targets.

**Personalization Stage**
For each investor, the agent crafts a personalized outreach email. It references specific portfolio companies that are relevant to your business. It mentions their recent LinkedIn posts or tweets to show you've done your homework. It highlights specific achievements or metrics from your company that would appeal to their investment thesis. It identifies mutual connections for warm introductions.

The agent generates multiple versions - the email subject line, body content, key talking points, and suggested attachments or follow-up materials.

**Human Approval Stage**
Before any email gets sent, you review and approve it. The Streamlit dashboard shows you the generated email alongside the investor profile and reasoning. You can edit the email, adjust talking points, or reject it entirely. This ensures every outreach maintains your personal voice and judgment.

**Outreach Execution Stage**
Once approved, the agent sends the email through your connected Gmail account. It logs the send time, tracks opens and clicks, and monitors for responses. The system maintains a full audit trail of all communications.

**Follow-up & Tracking Stage**
The agent monitors responses and categorizes them - interested, not interested, requested more information, or scheduled a meeting. Based on the response type and timing, it suggests follow-up actions and can even draft follow-up emails for your approval.

It maintains a dashboard showing your campaign performance - open rates, response rates, meetings scheduled, and pipeline progress. It also queues up follow-up reminders based on investor engagement patterns.

**Continuous Learning**
The system learns from successful outreach patterns. If certain types of personalization or subject lines get better responses, it incorporates that learning into future email generation. It also updates investor profiles based on new information discovered during the outreach process.

The entire flow is designed to transform the manual, time-intensive process of investor research and outreach into an automated, systematic approach that maintains the personal touch and human judgment that's crucial for fundraising success.
